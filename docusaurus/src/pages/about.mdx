# Through Thyck and Thin

As a team of programmers, but first, friends, our team was not formed without humble beginnings.
Founded in October, 2020, Thyck Corgis entered their very first programming competition.
Little did they know, their love for programming would grow into something thycker.

Join Thyck Corgis in our journey of making software projects.
